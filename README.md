I keep my development diary in repo of [Transition-to-C17](https://github.com/Shihao-Song/Transition-to-C17)

This simulator is still in the process of re-architecting.

We are using Google Protocol Buffers to store CPU traces, so please install [the latest release](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf)
